# sprinkle-nvim
Neovim setup that works for sprinkles.

## Setup

This should work out of the box! If you see some error messages that `packer` is not installed, then follow these steps: https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#bootstrapping

Or just do this

```bash
nvim --headless -c 'autocmd User PackerComplete quitall' -c 'PackerSync'
```
